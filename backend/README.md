# Telemetry Backend

## Deploying

[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) is required. The following command will build and deploy the backend in daemonized mode. 
```sh
docker-compose up -d --build
```

To teardown, run `docker-compose down`.
```sh
docker-compose up -d --build
```
